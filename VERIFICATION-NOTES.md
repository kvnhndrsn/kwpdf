# Verification notes — open checks and touch-ups

Things that still need a human look, or that I changed and could not fully prove.
Companion to `REMAINING-WORK.md` (the work order); this file is the "did we
actually check it?" list. Delete a line when it has been confirmed, not when it
has been coded.

## Bugs found while verifying (not in the work order)

- **Per-file OCR button does nothing, silently.** `#kwGridOcrBtn` shows for a
  loaded PDF, but clicking it leaves the status bar unchanged and creates no
  worker — `startOcrForFile` (`src/ocr.ts`) returns at one of its three silent
  guards (no `docTextCache` entry, `totalPages` 0, not a `.pdf`), each of which
  only sets `ocrFileState` to `error`. The OCR runtime itself is fine (see C6
  below). Needs a status-bar reason and a fix.
- **Corrupt single-file drop reports success.** Dropping `bad.pdf` alone ends
  with "1 document scanned" and leaves no tree row — a misleading success
  message. `0.16` covers the batch/folder path only.
- **Document loading stalls in a hidden tab.** pdf.js renders through
  `requestAnimationFrame`, which is paused while the tab is hidden, so a
  document opened in the background finishes loading only when you return to the
  tab. C4 fixed this for search only.

## Browser checks still outstanding (Part 0 rows)

Verified: 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.15.

Never exercised in a browser:

| Row | What |
|---|---|
| 0.3 | Blank line in a saved keyword list — no hang, counts unchanged |
| 0.9 | Keyword edit → rescan updates tree counts without reloading docs |
| 0.10 | Keyword list delete (falls back) and import (rescans) |
| 0.11 | Service worker network-first for `index.html`/`bundle.js` |
| 0.12 | Manifest icon loads, no 404 for `icons/favicon.ico` |
| 0.13 | OCR on two PDFs + "Clear all" leaves no workers, highlights or CPU burn |
| 0.14 | 20-PDF batch drop leaves no growing pdf.js workers/documents |
| 0.16 | Folder with one corrupt PDF: no dead tree row, cache total excludes it |
| 0.17 | 500-page PDF: page indicator tracks fast scrolling without long tasks |
| 0.18 | 500–1,000 page PDF: first page paints before all pages are set up |
| 0.19 | Prerender window: ~11 canvases around the current match, far jumps work |
| 0.20 | Canvas eviction near ±30 pages; highlights, measurements, selection survive |
| 0.21 | 200-doc rescan renders the tree once; "Clear all" mid-rescan stops cleanly |
| 0.22 | 50-page DOCX import time vs. before; counts and page attribution identical |
| 0.23 | Keyword dropdown not rebuilt on Next/Prev; selection follows |
| 0.24 | OCR badge pulses while running and stops afterwards; no 50 ms timers |

## Changes worth a second look

- **C6 — OCR self-hosting.** Ships ~11 MB into `dist/tesseract/`. Only the LSTM
  cores are included (oem 1 everywhere), and only their `.js` halves, because
  those builds inline the wasm as base64; a future `tesseract.js-core` bump could
  switch back to a sibling `.wasm` file, which would break OCR with a
  "Failed to load TesseractCore" error. Re-check `dist/tesseract/` after any
  dependency bump. `workerBlobURL: false` is deliberate — the blob-worker default
  cannot resolve same-origin paths from the core glue. Core + language data are
  cached on first *use*, not at install, so a fresh profile's first OCR run pulls
  11 MB from the app origin; confirm that is the intended trade.
- **B3 — measurement keys.** Keys are now folder-relative (`A/drawing.pdf`).
  Confirmed via `localStorage.kwpdf_measurements` that two `drawing.pdf` files
  keep separate sets, but the measurement *overlay* did not render in my
  headless run even for the file I measured, so on-screen isolation on
  switching documents is unconfirmed.
- **B7 — rotated text runs.** Both extractors (main thread and
  `doc_processor_worker.js`) now measure gaps along the run's own axis, and unit
  tests cover 90°/270°/adjacent/gapped/sideways cases. Not yet exercised on a
  real PDF whose content stream draws rotated text: `rotated.pdf` uses `/Rotate
  90`, which rotates the page but leaves the text runs horizontal, so it does not
  reach this code. A fixture with `0 1 -1 0 x y Tm` text is worth adding.
- **C2 — wrapped highlights.** Confirmed on `wrap.pdf` (two marks, 40 px and
  60 px). Not checked: a match that wraps across a page or column boundary.
- **D3 — build hash.** `CACHE_NAME` now changes for any shipped file. Note that
  the 11 MB of OCR assets are part of that hash, so any dependency bump also
  invalidates the whole asset cache for every client.

## Re-running the harness

```
npm run build                      # wipes dist/, so regenerate fixtures after
node .verify/make-fixtures.mjs
python3 -m http.server 8895 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory dist
```

Fixtures live in `dist/fixtures/` (`one-kw`, `mixed`, `wrap`, `rotated`, `large`,
`bad`, `repeated-3.docx`, `waiting.docx`, `two-folders/A|B/drawing.pdf`,
`html-folder/<b>x</b>/plain.pdf`). The service worker is cache-first for assets:
after a rebuild, reload the page and fetch fixtures with a fresh `?v=N`, or you
will get stale bytes.

Useful checks that caught false failures before:

```js
// OCR runtime, without going through the app UI
const w = new Worker('/utils/ocr_worker.js?h=probe');
// draw text on a canvas, toBlob, postMessage {task:'ocr-page', data:{...}}
```

The dev server log (`stderr`) is the reliable record of what was fetched — worker
subrequests do not appear in DevTools-style network logs.
